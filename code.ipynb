    "## Project scope\n",
    "In this project we set out to get a list of top 10 000 board games on BoardGameGeek (with links), and then use this list to scrap individual pages for more detailed info.  \n",
    "## Execution\n",
    "Scrapping the top list was fast because we were able to work using requests.get(). Scrapping the individual board games has proven more difficult. The website uses javascript to dynamically load the important part of the page, so using the simple requests.get() wasn't a success.   \n",
    "To overcome this challenge, we needed to use a emulated browser to execute the JS code. We chose Selenium, because we had some experience with it during the previous semester. Since this process is much slower, we decided to scrap only 100 individual pages. We also didn't want to burden the server, but since BGG is a very popular website, the additional 1 000 visits probably wouldn’t make a difference anyway. \n",
